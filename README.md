Description of the project "MovieBot":

The "MovieBot" project is an intelligent assistant developed for Telegram, aimed at helping users find movie recommendations. The project includes the development of a Telegram bot that interacts with users, receives queries, and provides movie suggestions based on their preferences. The bot utilizes various technologies and algorithms to analyze existing solutions and offer personalized recommendations.

Technologies used:

To develop the "MovieBot" project, the following technologies and software packages were employed:

- Telegram API: The bot interacts with users through the Telegram messaging platform.
- Java: The programming language used for the implementation of the bot's functionality.
- Kinopoisk.ru API: The bot retrieves movie data, including descriptions, covers, and viewing links, from the Kinopoisk.ru API.
- Artificial Intelligence: The project leverages AI algorithms to enhance the movie recommendation process.
- ProxyAPI: A proxy API was utilized to ensure secure and reliable communication between the bot and external services.

The Maven project has the following dependencies:

- org.telegram:telegrambots version 6.0.1: This dependency provides the required libraries for interacting with the Telegram API and developing Telegram bots.
- org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient version 4.5.13: This dependency includes the Apache HttpClient library, which is used for making HTTP requests and handling responses in the project.
- junit:junit version 3.8.1: This dependency is specifically used for testing purposes. It provides the JUnit framework for writing and executing unit tests.
